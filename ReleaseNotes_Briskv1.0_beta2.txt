About Brisk
***********************************
Brisk is an open-source Hadoop and Hive distribution developed by DataStax that
utilizes Apache Cassandra for its core services and storage. Brisk provides
Hadoop MapReduce capabilities using CassandraFS, an HDFS-compatible storage
layer inside Cassandra. By replacing HDFS with CassandraFS, users are able to
leverage their current MapReduce jobs on Cassandra’s peer-to-peer,
fault-tolerant, and scalable architecture. Brisk is also able to support dual
workloads, allowing you to use the same cluster of machines for both real-time
applications and data analytics without having to move the data around between
systems.  Brisk is now available via Apache license v2.0. The DataStax team
welcomes your valued feedback.

***********************************
Release Contents
***********************************
Brisk is comprised of the following components. For component-specific information, refer to their respective release notes and documentation.
• Apache Hadoop 0.20.203.0 + (HADOOP-7172, HADOOP-5759, HADOOP-7255)
• Cassandra 0.8.1
• Apache Hive 0.7
• Apache Pig 0.8.3

***********************************
New Features in Brisk 1.0 Beta 2
***********************************
The following new features have been added in this release. For more
information on these features, see the Brisk Jira Project
(https://datastax.jira.com/browse/BRISK).

BRISK-12
Apache Pig Integration.  For more information about using Pig in Brisk, see:
http://www.datastax.com/docs/0.8/brisk/about_pig

BRISK-89
Job Tracker Failover. For more information about using the new brisktool movejt
command, see:
http://www.datastax.com/docs/8.0/brisk/about_hive#setting-the-job-tracker-node-for-brisk

BRISK-207
New Snappy Compression Codec built on Google Snappy is now used internally for
automatic CassandraFS block compression.

BRISK-180
Automap Cassandra Column Families to Hive Tables in the Brisk Hive Metastore.

BRISK-152
Add a second HDFS layer in CassandraFS for long-term data storage. This is
needed because the blocks column family in CFS requires frequent compactions -
Hadoop uses it during MapReduce processing to store small files and temporary
data. Compaction cleans this temporary data up after it is not needed anymore.
Now there is the cfs:/// and cfs-archive:/// endpoints within CFS. The blocks
column family in cfs-archive:/// has compaction disabled to improve performance
for static data stored in CFS.

***********************************

Upgrading from Beta 1 to Beta 2
***********************************
Perform a rolling upgrade by performing the following steps on each node in your Brisk cluster, one node at a time.
1. Flush the commit log: nodetool drain
2. Stop any client applications.
3. Stop the Brisk service: service brisk stop
4. Upgrade the Brisk packages to Beta 2.

On RedHat Systems: yum upgrade brisk-full brisk-demos
On Debian Systems:  apt-get upgrade brisk-full brisk-demos
For Binary Installs: Download and unpack the tar file and update $BRISK_HOME
and $PATH to point to the new location.

5. Restart Brisk:  service brisk start
